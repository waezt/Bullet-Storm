# Bullet Storm

This repository contains my A-Level Computer Science NEA project called Bullet Storm.  
It was developed in Python and demonstrates my ability to design, develop, test, and evaluate a complete software solution.

## Overview
The project is an endless 2D shooter game featuring adaptive enemy AI that changes behaviour based on player position and becomes progressively harder as the game continues.  
It includes a secure login system with hashed passwords, as well as accessibility features such as three colourblind modes and custom keybinds to suit user needs.

Due to copyright restrictions, the asset files are not included in this repositry. Therefore, the program cannot be run directly from this repository but instead i will attatch a demo video showcasing the project in action. (Note demo does not include audio due to MacOS limitations)
The demo video can be viewed here: [Demo Video](https://youtu.be/0ZjuTsnxA_Y)

- **Documentation** – Full written report including analysis, design, development, testing, and evaluation  


## Notes
- Created for the OCR A-Level Computer Science NEA  
- Code, documentation, and demo video are my original work
