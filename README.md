# Bullet Storm

This repository contains my A-Level Computer Science NEA project called Bullet Storm.  
It was developed in Python and demonstrates my ability to design, develop, test, and evaluate a complete software solution.

## Overview
The project is an endless 2D shooter game featuring adaptive enemy AI that changes behaviour based on player position and becomes progressively harder as the game continues.  
It includes a secure login system with hashed passwords, as well as accessibility features such as three colourblind modes and custom keybinds to suit user needs.

Due to copyright restrictions, the asset files are not included in this repositry. Therefore, the program cannot be run directly from this repository but instead i will attatch a demo video showcasing the project in action

## Contents
- **Full Source Code** – All Python files used in development  
- **Documentation** – Full written report including analysis, design, development, testing, and evaluation  
- **Demo Video** – A complete walkthrough of the program in action  

## Notes
- Created for the OCR A-Level Computer Science NEA  
- Code, documentation, and video are my original work
